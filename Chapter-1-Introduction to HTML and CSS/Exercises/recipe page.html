            <h2><strong>Step 1:</strong> Bring water, milk and spices to a simmer in a small saucepan on the stove (adding the spices from the start gives them plenty of time to infuse).</h2>
                <h2><strong>Step 2:</strong> Reduce heat and add in black tea to brew.</h2>
                    <h2><strong>Step 3:</strong>Wait for tea to steep (don’t boil it at this point or the tea releases too many tannins – those bitter compounds that make your mouth feel dry).</h2>
                        <h2><strong>Step 4:</strong>Strain the warm spiced mixture into a mug; this will hold back the whole spices and tea leaves.</h2>
                            <h2><strong>Step 5:</strong>Stir sugar into your chai and sweeten to taste.</h2>
        </ol>
