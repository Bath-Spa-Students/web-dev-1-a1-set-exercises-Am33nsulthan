		<p>"first initial 45 minutes of the film faded with boredom and annoyed as you couldn’t find any interesting part, neither can you point any interlinking among the two people who swipe their characters for their own reasons. The plot is unclear. It makes you wait for the loo break to grab some free air of it.-koimoi</p>
		<p>"Dialogues for Vijay are as per his standards. Though not initially, but lately it does a justice to the movie title “Kaththi”." - IGN
